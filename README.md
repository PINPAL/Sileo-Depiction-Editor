# Jailbreak Repo Depiction Creator
## Generate a Sileo Depiction
These can even be used to generate web based depictions (for Cydia/Zebra) using my repo viewer.

***Note:**
This is a beta release, many features do not work correctly or simply do not function. You can make a depiction using the software in its current state but it's pretty broken. I'm not sure when/if I'll finish this project so this is why I'm opening the source up.
